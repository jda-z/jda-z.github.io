    <h1>Personal Interests</h1>
    <h2>Food & Cooking</h2>
        <p>Eating food is one of my most favorite things to do. Below is a list of some resturants I like to eat at! </p>
        
        <h4>The Globe</h4>
            <p>10/10</p>
            <p>Creamy curry noodles are to die for... One of my most favorite resturants since my freshman year.</p>

        <h4>La Hacienda</h4>
            <p>9/10</p>
            <p>Insane value if you share with others. Very good flavor, but I feel like I have tasted better tacos somewhere else. Highly recommend any of the Parrillda. 
            <div>

        <h4>SGD DUBU SO GONG DONG TOFU & KOREAN BBQ</h4>
            <p>9/10</p>
            <p>I love Korean food. Good soup... good bulgogi... I just think its a bit over priced, but the convenience on State Street is nice when compared to Five Star or Sol's on the Square.

        <h4>Izakaya Kuroyama</h4>
            <p>7/10</p>
            <p>Decent food, but not fully worth the price. Good hours- open late. Karaoke on Friday and Saturday nights are fun!
            <div>

        <p>Here I have some foods I have cooked with my sous chef :)</p>
        <h4>Korean Kimchi Jigae and Bulgogi Chicken</h4>
            <p>Easiest and most tasty food to make. Kimchi Jigae was very forgiving to make with just 6 ingredients: kimchi, spam, onion, tofu, gochugaru, and gochujang! The Bulgogi Chicken was very easy as well. Just cook the ground chicken and add the homemade sauce.</p>

        <h4>Stir-Fry</h4>
            <p>Stir-fry is another very easy dish to cook. You just throw everything into a pan, and it turns out tasty! Here are two Thai dishes: Pad Kra Pao and Thai noodle dish.</p>
            <div>

        <h4>Other</h4>
            <p>Here are the dishes that we are particularily proud of: pork belly and pasta!<p>

    <h2>YouTube:Crocheting and Makeup</h2>
        <p> I am a very new beginner at chrocheting and mediocre at doing makeup. In my free time, I like to watch Youtube tutorials to better both skills. Here are some Youtube tutorials I have followed (tried to follow).
